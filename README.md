Hope Harvest is a revolutionary web application designed to tackle food waste and address hunger in communities by facilitating the redistribution of surplus food to those in need.
<br>

At its core, Hope Harvest serves as a digital platform connecting food donors, such as restaurants, grocery stores, and catering services, with local charities, shelters, and food banks. Through an intuitive and user-friendly interface, donors can easily upload details about surplus food items they wish to donate, including quantity, expiration dates, and pickup location.
<br>

Charitable organizations can then browse available donations in their area and request items that align with their needs. Hope Harvest streamlines the donation process, making it efficient and hassle-free for both donors and recipients.
<br>
