Hope Harvest is a revolutionary web application designed to tackle food waste and address hunger in communities by facilitating the redistribution of surplus food to those in need.
<br>

At its core, Hope Harvest serves as a digital platform connecting food donors, such as restaurants, grocery stores, and catering services, with local charities, shelters, and food banks. Through an intuitive and user-friendly interface, donors can easily upload details about surplus food items they wish to donate, including quantity, expiration dates, and pickup location.

Charitable organizations can then browse available donations in their area and request items that align with their needs. Hope Harvest streamlines the donation process, making it efficient and hassle-free for both donors and recipients.
